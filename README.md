# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-Pytorch

## Introduction

We based our project on this github : https://github.com/atulapra/Emotion-detection. This github is a facial emotion recognition project done in Keras and TFLearn. We basically have done the same but in pytorch, and modified the Neural Network a little bit.
Moreover we used a pretained model of a VGG network that we obtained from this other github project : https://github.com/XiaoYee/emotion_classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used is Fer2013.
